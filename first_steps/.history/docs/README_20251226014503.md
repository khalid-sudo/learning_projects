# Hi Everyone
>First Steps In My  Python Learning Path
+ Hello if your reading this just know that i'm pretty sure i'm confused as your are.
+ I decided to break the ice and try to learn python concepts in the ERA of evolving technologies with a tremendous speed 
+ This is the first brick i'm gone use t build the entire house that ggona hst my entire knwoledge about python.
+ The way this repo will be populated depend on the skills i developp by the time throught simple use cases until it get's though.
Below i'll be mentioning every deatil i'll need to procced with my learning, every strugle wil be shared here.

First question i have in mind is how should i name th file?
Is it  really important to find a good name for it?
Is there any pattern i shoud follow?.
The first thing i did is to know which version of python i'm using.
So For me it was as i'm writing this, i'm using the  `python 3.13.2`.
When i looked over the intenet it's says that theris isn't a dirct connection betwen the python version and the pep reference
which stands for "Python Enhancement Proposal",but basicly the first pep was publiched in  2000 it's pep0 which is the index that conatin all Python Enhancement Proposals. So when i lloked for what is the **Style Guide for Python Code** i git the pep 8 guide line as a reference and heris the link that explain how the code should be including the naming convention
