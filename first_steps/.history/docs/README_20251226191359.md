# Hi Everyone
> First Steps In My  Python Learning Path
+ Hello if your reading this just know that i'm pretty sure i'm confused as your are.
+ I decided to break the ice and try to learn python concepts in the ERA of evolving technologies with a tremendous speed 
+ This is the first brick i'm gone use t build the entire house that ggona hst my entire knwoledge about python.
+ The way this repo will be populated depend on the skills i developp by the time throught simple use cases until it get's though.
Below i'll be mentioning every deatil i'll need to procced with my learning, every strugle wil be shared here.

>First questions that pop up are:
+ How should i name th file?
+ Is it  really important to find a good name for it?
+ Is there any pattern i shoud follow?

The first thing i did is to know which version of python i'm using.
So For me it was as i'm writing this, i'm using the  `python 3.13.2`.
When i looked over the intenet it's says that theris isn't a direct connection between the python version and the pep reference
which stands for "Python Enhancement Proposal",but basicly the first pep was publiched in  2000 it's pep0 which is the index that conatin all Python Enhancement Proposals. So when i looked for what is the **Style Guide for Python Code** i got the pep 8 guide line as a reference and heris the link [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) that explain how the code should be including the naming convention. So in order to know if the pep reference is still used or not you'll find  in the header bunch of information including the authors and most importantly the day of creation and the status that can be one of the states bellow:
+ A — Accepted: Normative proposal accepted for implementation
+ A — Active: Currently valid informational guidance, or an in-use process
+ D — Deferred: Inactive draft that may be taken up again at a later time
+ <No letter> — Draft: Proposal under active discussion and revision
+ F — Final: Accepted and implementation complete, or no longer active
+ P — Provisional: Provisionally accepted but additional feedback needed
+ R — Rejected: Formally declined and will not be accepted
+ S — Superseded: Replaced by another succeeding PEP
+ W — Withdrawn: Removed from consideration by sponsor or authors
>
which in our case it's still active for the pep 8 that was last updated on August 1, 2013. We can conclude that the reference isn't related directly to the python version because even older pep versions can be applied to newer versions of python like the one i'm using.
For those who are intrested in the details of how the naming convetion should be , i invite you to read their doccumentation [PEP 8 Documentation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions), but if i want to samurize:
+ The naming should have a meaning.
+ The use of underscore between the names is one of the ways i can use to name the variables, same for the functions.
+ The classes(we'll see about that later) should start with a capital letter.
+ The use of Identation using either spaces or tabs.

And bunch of other ways that let our code to look clean. 
So far with the knowledge we have in our hands. we can start building our first lines of code.
I invite evryone to do the same because the idea if the repo is to let you come up wit new ideas but and for each one of you should bbe sincere and know how to define your technical level. for me the levels are pretty realtive to each individual so just try to come up with a pretty basic idea that you can implement. and let's do the exercice.
>Idea
For me the idea that i see fit is trying to compare the time execution of too files?
Why i choosed this cause as long as i'm learning i'll write some code and i'll try to generate one with the gen AI's and see what's the diffrence and what should i reimplment diffrently in terms of efficiency and time of execution.
and this idea will help throught all the work i will do later either to compare diffrent libraries or function that do approximatly the same thing but they are diffrent.
so i'll make the v0 of the file and hopefully i get a vN that will be the best version i could achieve.
the project stucture looks like this .
```
├── data
│   └── text.txt
├── docs
│   └── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── read_files
│   └── compare_perf.py
```
So i looked over the internet i searched for how read a file and this is what i found:
+ ```file = "./data/text.txt"
    content = open(file,"r")
    for word in content:
        print(word)```

The problem with this approach is that i njeed to manually close the file after open statement.
if we don't use the close fucntion this is what it could happen:
+ Hit the open file limit and not be able to open more.
+ Can lose data if the power fails.
>Solution 1:
+ we close the file using close() function. This is good but it adds another line of code
```file = "./data/text.txt"
    content = open(file,"r")
    for word in content:
        print(word)
    content.close()
```
> Solution 2:
we use the with statement which is also know as a best practice manner:
```file = "./data/text.txt"
    with open(file,"r") as word:
        for line in word:
            print(line)
```
this way we are sure that nce the program finches teh file will be closed.
One thing we should add to this code is the error handling the file might not exist so we should handle that case too
In order to catch an exception in python we use the try except statement.
``` file = "text.txt"
    try:
        with open(file,"r") as word:
            for line in word:
                print(line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("the file wasn't found")
```
and if want to give it more context we'll use the f tsrinf statement

``` file = "text.txt"
    try:
        with open(file,"r") as word:
            for line in word:
                print(line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("the file wasn't found")
```
